MNote is a note taking app, similar to notepad. 

The main design of the app is minimalism and keyboard shortcuts. 

The app is made with C++ and Qt6.

Currently in development. 


For a better performance of the app is to use QPlainText. This would allow the user to write a lot ( < 1,000 words) without lag. This comes at a cost of having not allignment features. Maybe I will implement a tutorial on how to change QTextEdit -> QPlainText.
